# Assignment 1 
# Name: Mikayla Morrison
# Student ID: 501182358

#For this assignment, I decided to address an issue that all too many student face; the issue of calculating student loans.
#As a student who has looked into a line a credit, I can honestly say that understanding interest, interest rates, loans, and credit has been quite 
#a struggle for me. To resolve this problem and help other students understand how a loan functions, I have created a program 
#that would calculates loans. The goal of the program is to help students understand how loans, interest, and payments can become vital 
#and costly aspects of funding a post-secondary education. 

#The following program determines the student's total tuition for their first year of university,maccording to faculty and eligbilibity for entrance scholarships. 
#The figures used pertain only to full-time domestic students (in-province and out of province). 

#It is assumed that the student is unable to pay their tuition in full; so, the program helps students start a line of credit, 
#take out a loan, and begin to pay off their loan over the course of 365 days (interest compounded daily). 

#All of the figures and amounts used in this program are based on the latest information from TMU and several banks/private institutions. 


def faculty_tuition(faculty): 
    #This function calculates the user's tuition/payments to the university based on the faculty defined in the main function. 
    tuition_fee = {"ARTS":7084.00, "COMMUNITY SERVICES":7341.00, "ENGINEERING":10749.50, "SCIENCE":8313.00, "CREATIVE SCHOOL":7462.00, "TED ROGERS SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT":9226.00}
    #A dictionary; this was used to find the tuition based on the user's faculty. 
    #These figures are based on average costs as defined by the TMU website; https://www.torontomu.ca/current-students/tuition-fees/
    global tuition_base
    #A variable that has been assigned global status using the global keyword: this makes the tuition base (the value of the element in the dictionary) accesible to every function in the program. 
    #This is necessary as the tuition_base becomes essential to the calculation of loan in the function loan_calculation
    tuition_base = float(tuition_fee[faculty.upper()]) #.....not sure if i need to convert this to a float......
    #Retrieves the value based on the key (faculty) in the dictionary. 
    #Converts the value of the key to a float type, and assigns this value to the variable tuition_base. 
    #The variable has now been assigned a value that we will use for other calculations in different functions of the program.

                #at index i. This gives us the total value of the loan including interest. Finally, the round() method is used to round the result to 
                #2 decimal places. 
                #This calculation then adds the total value of the loan to the variable we defined as 0 earlier on. This variable is called later on in the program to 
                #show the user a record of their debts and payments. 

                #It is also to be noted that while the interest rate is typically fixed for federal loans as well as student loan,
