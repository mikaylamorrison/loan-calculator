# loan-calculator
Assignment for Beginner Python Class; really helped m get a good grasp on the basics!

For this assignment, I wanted to create a program that would calculate some form of 
credit to help students understand how loans, interest, and payments can become vital and costly aspects of funding a post-secondary education. 

The following program determines the student's total tuition for their first year of university,maccording to faculty and eligbilibity for entrance scholarships. 
The figures used pertain only to full-time domestic students (in-province and out of province). 

It is assumed that the student is unable to pay their tuition in full; so, the program helps students start a line of credit, 
take out a loan, and begin to pay off their loan over the course of 365 days (interest compounded daily). 

# All of the figures and amounts used in this program are based on the 2022 tuition information from TMU and several banks/private institutions.
