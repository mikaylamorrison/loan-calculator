# loan-calculator
Assignment for Beginner Python Class; really helped m get a good grasp on the basics!

For this assignment, I wanted to create a program that would calculate some form of 
credit to help students understand how loans, interest, and payments can become vital and costly aspects of funding a post-secondary education. 

The following program determines the student's total tuition for their first year of university, according to faculty and eligbilibity for entrance scholarships. 
The figures used pertain only to full-time domestic students (in-province and out of province). 

It is assumed that the student is unable to pay their tuition in full; so, the program helps students start a line of credit, 
take out a loan, and begin to pay off their loan over the course of 365 days (interest compounded daily). 

# All of the figures and amounts used in this program are based on the 2022 tuition information from TMU and several banks/private institutions.
